  "readme": "# fast-levenshtein - Levenshtein algorithm in Javascript\n\n[![Build Status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/hiddentao/fast-levenshtein.png)](http://travis-ci.org/hiddentao/fast-levenshtein)\n\nAn efficient Javascript implementation of the [Levenshtein algorithm](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Levenshtein_distance) with asynchronous callback support.\n\n## Features\n\n* Works in node.js and in the browser.\n* Reduced memory usage compared to other implementations by not needing to store the whole matrix ([more info](http://www.codeproject.com/Articles/13525/Fast-memory-efficient-Levenshtein-algorithm)).\n* Provides synchronous and asynchronous versions of the algorithm.\n* Asynchronous version is almost as fast as the synchronous version for small strings and can also provide progress updates.\n* Comprehensive test suite.\n* Small: <1 KB minified and gzipped\n\n## Installation\n\n### node.js\n\nInstall using [npm](http://npmjs.org/):\n\n    $ npm install fast-levenshtein\n\n### Browser\n\nAdd the following inside your HTML:\n\n    <script type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"https://github.com/hiddentao/fast-levenshtein/raw/master/levenshtein.min.js\"></script>\n\nThe API will then be accessible via the `window.Levenshtein` object.\n\n## Examples\n\n**Synchronous**\n\n    var levenshtein = require('fast-levenshtein');\n\n    var distance = levenshtein.get('back', 'book');   // 2\n    var distance = levenshtein.get('我愛你', '我叫你');   // 1\n\n\n**Asynchronous**\n\n    var levenshtein = require('fast-levenshtein');\n\n    levenshtein.getAsync('back', 'book', function (err, distance) {\n      // err is null unless an error was thrown\n      // distance equals 2\n    });\n\n**Asynchronous with progress updates**\n\n    var levenshtein = require('fast-levenshtein');\n\n    var hugeText1 = fs.readFileSync(...);\n    var hugeText2 = fs.readFileSync(...);\n\n    levenshtein.getAsync(hugeText1, hugeText2, function (err, distance) {\n      // process the results as normal\n    }, {\n      progress: function(percentComplete) {\n        console.log(percentComplete + ' % completed so far...');\n      }\n    );\n\n## Building and Testing\n\nTo build the code simply run [grunt](http://gruntjs.com/):\n\n    $ grunt\n\nThis will run the tests followed by [jshint](http://jshint.com) followed by [uglify](https://github.com/mishoo/UglifyJS). To run the tests on their own do:\n\n    $ grunt mochaTest\n\n\n## Contributing\n\nIf you wish to submit a pull request please update and/or create new tests for any changes you make and ensure the grunt build passes.\n\n---\n\nHomepage: [https://github.com/hiddentao/fast-levenshtein](https://github.com/hiddentao/fast-levenshtein)\n\n\nCopyright (c) 2013 [Ramesh Nair](http://www.hiddentao.com/)\n\nPermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person\nobtaining a copy of this software and associated documentation\nfiles (the \"Software\"), to deal in the Software without\nrestriction, including without limitation the rights to use,\ncopy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell\ncopies of the Software, and to permit persons to whom the\nSoftware is furnished to do so, subject to the following\nconditions:\n\nThe above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be\nincluded in all copies or substantial portions of the Software.\n\nTHE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED \"AS IS\", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND,\nEXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES\nOF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND\nNONINFRINGEMENT.
